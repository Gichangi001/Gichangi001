<summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Gichangi's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a tech student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world - code, unix, linux, theory. And all the while, teaching myself web development with a dream to build my website, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in other fields. However, I had other desires I had been pursuing throughout this time Marketing and public relations. But there's something that's always bothered me about my journey - abandoning my dream of building my own app to pursue the safe route, a job. Now I've already taken the leap away from that safety net into this uncomfortable, unexplored world that it being a programmer. I do have to eat, at the end of the day, but I think it's time. It's time to get uncomfortable again. I have a burning desire to get back on the horse, and fulfill that dream younger me had of building my own app, my own product , my own websites. And in order to do that, I'll be implmementing a few measures to streamline my Journey to focus more time on fulfilling that dream - a dream that I'll be ready to tackle in 2023 due to the measures i set in place end of 2022. Don't wait up, because I'm coming.
